2 major problems - 
    1 - search bar currently not working prob because of the 2nd problem
    2 - the app is unoptimized at all, gotta go through the whole server/user controller and optimize their 
        communication, way less messages going on, make it way lower!

    after that -
        remove the option for users to choose their own topics for their chatroom
        add an option to "join to a room" literly just cuz the project asks for it

        ADMIN :(
        
        and done!

need to do-
    -stated above
    - search bar
    - text analaizing
    -admin
    -UI
    - find a way to calcuate the time a server and a user is up, delete chatroom accordingly

not urgent -
    -add an icon to the app




check if user already in room before letting him joinm
