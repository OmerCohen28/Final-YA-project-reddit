TODO for the messages feature - 

- after banning the user, remove him from all lists and stuff (for example so he won't show up in the users in a room list)

TODO what's left? - 
    - overhall the key words system, instead of calcing it evrytime, save it into the chatroom evrytime a new message is added 
        as a tupple/dict of word-score
    - make a window to show the admin the current top 20 words, give him an option of not allowing these words as actual key words
    - make a window for admin to make words that are not allowed to be used as key words server wide
