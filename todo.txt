need to think how to update the "current users" at each
user's screen, also how to broadcast new message

current thought - run a thread user side
waiting for updates on new message
if one comes, refresh the screen with the new message

how to send the message? keep a dictionary of all the online users and their matching socket, when someone leaves, remove them 
from the dictionary

current urgent problem is to make the server notify other users of changes!

besides that and UI i just have to do text analaizing and search bar

need to do-
    -stated above
    - search bar
    - text analaizing
    -admin
    -UI
    - find a way to calcuate the time a server and a user is up, delete chatroom accordingly

not urgent -
    -add an icon to the app
