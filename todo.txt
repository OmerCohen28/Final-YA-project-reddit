TODO for the messages feature - 

- after banning the user, remove him from all lists and stuff (for example so he won't show up in the users in a room list)

TODO what's left? - 
    - make a window for admin to make words that are not allowed to be used as key words server wide

UI to change - 
    search result UI

    swap view in chat screen btn UI

    show keywords in chat screen btn UI

    user list in chatroom UI

    ask for confirmation to kick users UI

    show all rooms for admin UI

    show all current online users for admin UI

To Test!! - 
    - after logging out as a user, check if server allows you to log back in (assume no crash and normal exit)
    - show all keywords for rooms, check wether key words are being added and showed 
    - live messages and notif for users
    - time change
    - show all users in chat room
    - show all current online users


after that -

        remove the option for users to choose their own topics for their chatroom

        look again at text analaizing and optimize it



not urgent -
    -add an icon to the app
